## About Project
The project is a practical towards building a classifier model class for a dataset with multiple targets (19 target columns). 
As perceived, the class should have a method for handling imbalanced dataset, balancing the train data but leaving the test/validation data as is. 
This test will go on with me testing for the best tweaks for the hyperpaarameters of the classifiers. 

### What's good?
Feel free to view the notebook for preprocessing, and preparation of data and the modeling.
